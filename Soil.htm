        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Soil is our life support system. Soils anchor roots, hold water and store nutrients. Soils are home to earthworms, termites and a myriad of micro-organisms that fix nitrogen and decompose organic matter. We build on soil as well as with it. 
            Soil provides plants a foothold for their roots and holds the necessary nutrients for plants to grow. Soil filters the rainwater and regulates the discharge of excess rainwater, preventing flooding.  It also buffers against pollutants, thus protecting groundwater quality.
            Soil functions are general soil capabilities that are important for many areas of life including agriculture, environmental management, nature protection, landscape architecture and urban applications.</p>

        <h2>Effects of Soil Pollution</h2>
        <p>Soil pollution can result in the degradation of soil quality, loss of biodiversity, and negative impacts on human health. It affects plant and animal life in the ecosystem.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Impaired Soil Fertility:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Soil pollution can lead to a decline in soil fertility by altering its nutrient composition. Excessive accumulation of pollutants, such as heavy metals and chemicals, can hinder the growth of plants and reduce agricultural productivity.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Contaminated Water Sources:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Pollutants from the soil can leach into groundwater or nearby water bodies, leading to water pollution. This contamination can affect aquatic ecosystems and compromise the quality of drinking water.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Harm to Plant and Animal Life:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Soil pollution negatively impacts the health and diversity of plant and animal species. Certain pollutants, like pesticides and heavy metals, can be toxic to plants and disrupt the food chain, affecting wildlife and ecosystems.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Human Health Risks:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Contaminated soil poses health risks to humans. The consumption of crops grown in polluted soil or exposure to contaminated dust can lead to the ingestion of harmful substances, causing various health issues, including respiratory problems, skin diseases, and organ damage.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Air Pollution:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Some pollutants in the soil can become airborne, contributing to air pollution. Dust particles carrying contaminants may be released into the atmosphere during soil erosion or other activities, impacting air quality.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Loss of Biodiversity:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Soil pollution can contribute to the loss of biodiversity by disrupting the natural balance within ecosystems. Species that are sensitive to pollutants may decline, while others that can tolerate pollution may become dominant.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Soil Erosion:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Soil pollution can exacerbate soil erosion, reducing the stability of the landscape. Contaminated soil may be more prone to erosion, leading to the loss of topsoil and further degradation of the land.</li>
